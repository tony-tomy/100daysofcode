Azure Virtual Machine

Virtual Machine Disk

Azure VM uses Standard (HDD) or Premium (SSD) storage to create disks,

Size of the VM determines the number of disks
Disks are used to store an OS, applications, and data.
VMs also can have one or more data disks.
Premium storage requires DS or GS-series of VMs.
Disks are stored as .Vhd files in the storage accounts.
All disks are stored as VHDs, and the maximum capacity is 4095 GB.

Deployment Scenarios
Typical deployment scenarios of VMs are listed below,

Create Test and Dev Environments
Extending your data center to the cloud
Hosting certain applications in the cloud that can leverage benefits of the cloud. Example - Seasonal Applications.
Installing Recovery Site using IaaS-based DRS approach that provides significant costs savings.
High-performance computing to solve complex problems involving millions of variables or calculations such as an earthquake.
Big data analysis that involves processing and mining massive datasets.

Planning Considerations
While planning for the virtual machine deployment, you have to consider the following,

Suitable and Unsuitable Workloads
Supported and Unsupported Server Roles
Supported and Unsupported Server Features

1. Suitable Workloads
Azure VMs can be used for the following Workloads.

Highly available service workloads. E.g., Online Stores.
Unpredictable Spikes - E.g., News Channels.
Periodic workloads - E.g., Retail sales spurt during Holiday Season.
Steady workloads - E.g., Extend or offload existing infrastructure to the cloud.

Unsuitable Workloads
When Planning Azure VMs, it is also important to understand that not every application or service is a suitable fit for the cloud.

Examples

Low volume or limited growth workloads - such services or applications can be run on commodity hardware on-premise and will be less expensive than in the cloud.
Regulated environment workloads - Certain data is regulated by an organization or the local government. Such restricted and confidential data must be kept on-premises.

2. Unsupported Server Roles
Most of the Windows Roles can be enabled on Azure VMs, but few Roles are not supported in Azure VM.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server
Hyper-V (Hyper-V role is supported in Azure Ev3 and Dv3 series VMs only)
Rights Management Services
Windows Deployment Services

3. Unsupported Server Features
The following significant features are not supported.

BitLocker Drive Encryption (on the operating system hard disk, may be used on data disks)
Internet Storage Name Server
Multipath I/O
Network Load Balancing
Peer Name Resolution Protocol
RRAS
DirectAccess
SNMP Services
Storage Manager for SANs
Windows Internet Name Service
Wireless LAN Service

Azure Cost Optimization Tools
Now you know the consideration, the next major planning factors with any cloud-based service are:

Availability of resources
Cost optimization.
To help with estimating the potential costs and to achieve the cost optimization following tools are used:

Pricing Calculator tool enables you to estimate the cost of different workloads and services in Microsoft Azure.

TCO Calculator estimates the cost savings that can be realized by migrating the application workloads to Microsoft Azure.

Pricing Calculator can be used to estimate the costs for Azure VMs.

VM size and Configuration decides the Cost of the VM

VM sizing is based on,

Compute: Capacity required
Storage: Size, location, and configuration
Disk: Size, persistence and caching
VM configuration deals with,

Operating System: Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016
IP Address allocation: Static or Dynamic IP addresses
Availability: Uptime requirements, geo-distribution, service level agreements, and accessibility.
Scale set: Type of scaling and threshold

Now we will create VMs using a Custom image. Images can be created for Generation 1 VMs that are in the VHD file format.

Steps to create VM using Custom Image:

On-Premise

Prepare the VM. Make sure the VM has all the roles and features installed.
Run sysprep to prepare the machine.
Prepare the VM VHD.
Azure On-Premise

Create the Storage Container.
Upload the VHD.
Create a VM using the uploaded VHD.

VM Creation

Getting Started with VM Creation
Now that you understand how to plan for VMs, next we will learn various ways of Provisioning VMs.

Tool for deploying VMs:

Azure Portal
Classic portal: V1 VMs only
New portal: Both V1 and V2 VMs
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
ARM Template
Versions of VM (V1 and V2) are different from Generations of VM such as G1 and G2.

Azure supports G1 VMs only

OS Image Sources
Azure Marketplace

Contains recent versions for Windows and Linux distributions
VM Depot

Community managed Repository of Linux and FreeBSD VM images
Custom Images

Enterprise OS images with Applications that must be captured from VM in the Organization and uploaded in Azure to create further VMs

ARM Templates
Resource Manager templates are JSON files that define the resources to be deployed for an Azure solution.

JSON editor or Visual Studio Code can be used to create templates.

Prerequisites to create a template:

Visual Studio Code.
Azure subscription.

Features and Benefits of ARM Templates
ARM Templates allow you to deploy identical environments to test staging and production, ensuring high reliability.

Templates can be stored in the Azure Subscription and reused.
An entire Resource group can be exported as a Template.
ARM Templates can create resources in parallel.
ARM Templates can define dependencies among resources.
ARM Templates can create custom policies to control actions or operations that can be performed on resources.
Importantly, ARM templates help to reduce human error when deploying complex environments.

ARM template is another way to create one or more Azure VMs quickly.

Steps:

Create the Template: You can create your own template or you can get it from Azure Quickstarts Templates.
Create the Parameter File: To specify values for the resource parameters that were defined in the template or parameters files.
Create the Resource Group: All resources, like virtual machines, must be part of a resource group.
Deploy the Template: Once the template and resource files are ready, use the New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment command to implement the resource.
The template file can be created with a simple text editor and the file type is JSON.

Azure Cloud Shell

Another popular way of managing VMs is using PowerShell or CLI interface. For this, you would need Azure Cloud Shell.

Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources.

Features of Azure Cloud Shell:

It is a free shell that can be run directly on the Azure portal.
It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.
Click the Cloud Shell button on the menu in the upper-right of the Azure portal, and you will able to launch both PowerShell and CLI interface.

It gives you the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work.

Knowing Cloud Shell
It runs on a temporary machine provided on a per-session, per-user basis.
It times out after 20 minutes without interactive activity.
It can only be accessed with a file share attached.
It uses the same file share for both Bash and PowerShell.
It is assigned to a one machine per user account basis.
Permissions are set as a regular Linux user (Bash).

Authentication and Pricing
Automatic authentication

Cloud Shell securely and automatically authenticates on each session for instant access to your resources through the Azure CLI 2.0.
Pricing

The machine hosting Cloud Shell is free, with a prerequisite of a mounted Azure file share.
Regular storage costs apply.
Use Cloud shell to create and manage the VMs.

Steps to Create VM using PS
Create Azure Connection

Create resource group

Create networking resources such as subnet, Vnet, NIC, Public IP Address.

Define a credential object

ComputerName - myVM
OS - Windows Server 2016 datacenter

Linux on Azure
Microsoft Endorsed some versions of Linux in the Azure Marketplace in which,

The Linux Integration Services (LIS) drivers for Hyper-V and Azure are kernel modules that are contributed directly from MS to the upstream Linux kernel.

The Azure Linux Agent is already pre-installed and the source code can be found on GitHub.

For Non-Endorsed Versions of Linux

You can bring your own Linux image by Creating and uploading a virtual hard disk that contains the Linux OS.

Endorsed distributions
Azure SLAs applies only to the Endorsed versions

CentOS 6.3+
CoreOS 494.4.0+
Debian 7.9+, 8.2+
Oracle Linux 6.4+, 7.0+

Accessing of Linux VMs
Once the Linux VMs are created, it is required to access the VM.

Here are the few ways to access the VMs,

Azure Cloud Shell (CLI)
Bash Shell from Windows 10
Putty software


Managing of Linux using Windows
A common problem encountered is how to easily manage Linux virtual machines from Windows environments.

Windows 10 now makes it possible to run Linux Bash natively.

Bash on Windows allows you to:

Run common command-line utilities such as grep, sed, and awk.
Use the Linux-compatible filesystem & heirarchy and access fixed Windows storage mounted under "/mnt/..."
Install additional Linux tools using apt
Invoke Windows applications from within Bash
Invoke Linux applications from within Windows
Run Bash shell scripts and Linux command-line apps, including:
Tools: vim, emacs, tmux
Languages: Javascript/node.js, Ruby, Python, C/C++, C# & F#, Rust, Go
Services: sshd, MySQL, Apache, lighttpd


Installing Bash on Windows 10:

Turn on Developer mode via Settings > Update and Security > For Developers.
Enable Bash in Windows by adding the Windows feature "Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta)".
Restart the Windows 10 workstation.
It can be enabled using PowerShell as:

Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
Accessing Bash on Windows 10:

Launch the command line and run the command Bash, to enter the Linux subsystem. (or)
From the Start Menu select Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

Managing Azure Virtual Machines
Once the VM is created, the following components must be configured to provide consistency and high availability.

IP Addresses
Availability Set
Auto Scaling

IP address is assigned to Azure resources to communicate with other Azure resources, on-premises network, and the Internet. It can be allocated in two ways,

Static Allocation
Dynamic Allocation
Types of IP Addresses

Public IP addresses - Used for communication with the Internet, including Azure public-facing services.
E.g.: VMs, Internet-facing LB, VPN GW, and Application GW.

Private IP addresses - Used for communication within an Azure virtual network (VNet), and on-premises network when a VPN is configured.
E.g.: VMs, Internal LB, and Application GW.

Dynamic allocation is the default method for both Private and Public IP Addresses.

Public IP Allocation
Dynamic allocation method:

The public IP address is allocated when you start/create the associated resource (like a VM or load balancer).
The IP address is released when you stop/delete the resource.
In this method IP address can change.

Static allocation method:

The IP address must be configured in "NIC" properties for the associated resource.
It is released only when you delete the resource or change its allocation method to dynamic.
In this method IP address will not change.

Private IP Addresses
Private IP Addresses

In both (dynamic or static) ways, the IP address is allocated from the address range of the subnet to which the resource is attached.

In Dynamic allocation method the IP address is automatically allocated from the resource's subnet (using DHCP). This IP address can change when the resource is stopped and started.

In Static allocation method, the IP address must be assigned from the allocated subnet and remains the unchanged till the VM is deleted.

Availability of Virtual Machines
By now, you should know that:

Availability set (AV set) is the Logical Grouping of two or more Azure VMs and their domains.
AV set protects from planned (updates) and unplanned (hardware) failures.
Here we will be focusing on Principles, SLAs and Creation of AV set.

Principles of creating Availability sets:

For redundancy, configure multiple VMs in an Availability Set.
Configure each application tier into separate Availability Sets.
Combine a Load Balancer with Availability Sets.

SLAs for Availability Sets
Azure offers the following SLAs if you use Availability set,

For all VMs that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set, Microsoft guarantees - VM Connectivity to at least one instance almost 99.95% of the time.

For any Single Instance VM using premium storage for all disks, Microsoft guarantees - VM Connectivity of at least 99.9%.

Azure Scale Set
As you know, Scale set makes it easier to build large-scale services targeting high compute, big data, and containerized workloads.

Scale sets are used to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs at the time of requirement.

Azure Resource Explorer

It is particularly useful for viewing Azure scale sets - Individual VMs and their properties.

Azure Resource Explorer is a great tool to view and modify resources that are created in the subscription.
The tool is web-based and uses the Azure portal login credentials.
The source for the Resource Explorer tool is available on GitHub.

Guidance for Scale Set
Both Linux and Windows VM Scale Sets can be configured from the Azure Portal.
These scale sets are automatically created with load balancer NAT rules to enable SSH or RDP connections.
Managed disks can have between 0 and 1000 VMs based on platform images OR 0 to 100 VMs based on custom images.
The maximum, minimum and default number of VMs setting must be based on resource consumption and actions are triggered automatically.
When the number of VMs is increased or decreased in a scale set, VMs are balanced across update and fault domains to ensure, maximum availability.
