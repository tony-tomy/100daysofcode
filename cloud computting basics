Basics

Cloud Computing is a way for delivering services or resources on-demand.

- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing 
resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction.

Cloud Components
The components are broadly classified into Frontend Components and Backend Components.

Frontend Components
Clients: Clients are the devices through which the end users interact. They are divided into three broad categories: mobile, thin and 
thick clients.Smartphones and tablets constitute mobile clients, while computers without an internal hard drive is a thin client, and 
thick clients are your typical computers.

Backend Components
Datacenter: It is a server or a collection of servers.
Distributed Servers: These servers are spread across multiple locations.
Storage, security and other such infrastructures add to the backend list.
Through a network layer, cloud establishes the connection between the frontend and backend devices.

Cloud Characteristics

1. Elasticity
2. On-demand
3. Provider-pooled computing resources
4. Metered service usage
5. Broad network access

Cloud computing is enabled through these key factors.

Virtualization

The process of creating a virtual environment in a resource, to enable execution of services without interfering with other activities done by the resource.

An ability that allows you to share the physical instance of an application or resource with multiple users.

Virtualization - Features
Prominent features of virtualization include:

Partitioning: You can partition a resource to support many applications and hardware.

Isolation: Every virtual instance is isolated from one another as well as from the resource.

Encapsulation: You can encapsulate a virtual instance as a single entity to easily identify the service it offers.
