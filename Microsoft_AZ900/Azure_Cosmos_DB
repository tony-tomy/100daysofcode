Azure Cosmos DB

Zooming into the Cosmos
Azure Cosmos DB is globally distributed, multi-model database from Microsoft.

It is a schema-less NoSQL database which supports SQL based queries (with few limitations).

Provides storage across multiple Azure's geographic regions with elastic and independent throughput scaling.

Offers throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees through comprehensive Service Level Agreements(SLAs).

Key Features
Cosmos DB provides:
Global distribution APIs
Horizontal scaling
Latency guarantees
High availability
Multiple Data models and their APIs
SLAs

Cosmos DB can provide near-real response times while handling massive amounts of data reads, and writes at a global scale for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT applications.

Global Distribution
Global Distribution or Turnkey global distribution facilitates data distribution near to the customers, over multiple Azure regions, while ensuring latency at its lowest.
Requests are always sent to the nearest data center, using multi-homing APIs, without any configuration changes.
APIs handle every task once write-regions and read-regions are set up.

Multi-homing API capability makes application redeploying redundant, in case of addition/removal of regions from your Azure Cosmos DB database.

Multi-Model Support
Atom-record-sequence (ARS) based data model underlie the Cosmos DB, providing native support for multiple data models like document, key-value, graph, table, and column-family.

Currently, the APIs for the following data models are supported with SDKs in multiple languages:

SQL API
MongoDB API
Cassandra API
Gremlin API
Table API

Future plans are laid out for additional data models and APIs 

Elastic and Independent Scaling
Throughput scaling can be configured at a per-second granularity.
Modification of throughput is simple and flexible.
Transparent and automatic Storage size scaling over Application Lifetime.
Features are supported, by all available data centers, around the world.

Schema-less Design
Rapid iteration of Application schema is possible without concern of database schema and/or index management.
Fully schema-agnostic - Do not require any schema or indexes, automatically indexes all the ingested data to serve blazing fast queries.

Availability
Guaranteed 99.99% availability SLA for all single region database accounts.
Guaranteed 99.999% read availability for multi-region database accounts.
Deployment to multiple Azure regions enables Higher availability and better performance.
Dynamic region priority setting and Failure Simulation in one or more regions with zero-data-loss guarantees(beyond just the database) can help test the End-to-End availability of the application.

Application Flexibility
Guaranteed end-to-end latency of reads under 10 ms and indexed writes under 15 ms for a typical 1KB item, within the same Azure region, with a median latency under 5 ms.
Latency guaranteed at the 99th percentile for almost real-time response in applications.
Provided with Five well-defined, practical, and intuitive consistency models.
The spectrum varies from strong SQL-like consistency to relaxed NoSQL-like eventual consistency which can be chosen and payed as per requirements.

Cost Management
As Per Microsoft Claims:
5 to 10 times cost effective than a non-managed solution or an on-prem NoSQL solution.
3 times cheaper than AWS DynamoDB or Google Spanner.
Industry-leading, financially backed, comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs) for availability, latency, throughput, and consistency for mission-critical data and money back guarantees to the customers.
