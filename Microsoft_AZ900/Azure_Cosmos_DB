Azure Cosmos DB

Zooming into the Cosmos
Azure Cosmos DB is globally distributed, multi-model database from Microsoft.

It is a schema-less NoSQL database which supports SQL based queries (with few limitations).

Provides storage across multiple Azure's geographic regions with elastic and independent throughput scaling.

Offers throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees through comprehensive Service Level Agreements(SLAs).

Key Features
Cosmos DB provides:
Global distribution APIs
Horizontal scaling
Latency guarantees
High availability
Multiple Data models and their APIs
SLAs

Cosmos DB can provide near-real response times while handling massive amounts of data reads, and writes at a global scale for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT applications.

Global Distribution
Global Distribution or Turnkey global distribution facilitates data distribution near to the customers, over multiple Azure regions, while ensuring latency at its lowest.
Requests are always sent to the nearest data center, using multi-homing APIs, without any configuration changes.
APIs handle every task once write-regions and read-regions are set up.

Multi-homing API capability makes application redeploying redundant, in case of addition/removal of regions from your Azure Cosmos DB database.

Multi-Model Support
Atom-record-sequence (ARS) based data model underlie the Cosmos DB, providing native support for multiple data models like document, key-value, graph, table, and column-family.

Currently, the APIs for the following data models are supported with SDKs in multiple languages:

SQL API
MongoDB API
Cassandra API
Gremlin API
Table API

Future plans are laid out for additional data models and APIs 

Elastic and Independent Scaling
Throughput scaling can be configured at a per-second granularity.
Modification of throughput is simple and flexible.
Transparent and automatic Storage size scaling over Application Lifetime.
Features are supported, by all available data centers, around the world.

Schema-less Design
Rapid iteration of Application schema is possible without concern of database schema and/or index management.
Fully schema-agnostic - Do not require any schema or indexes, automatically indexes all the ingested data to serve blazing fast queries.

Availability
Guaranteed 99.99% availability SLA for all single region database accounts.
Guaranteed 99.999% read availability for multi-region database accounts.
Deployment to multiple Azure regions enables Higher availability and better performance.
Dynamic region priority setting and Failure Simulation in one or more regions with zero-data-loss guarantees(beyond just the database) can help test the End-to-End availability of the application.

Application Flexibility
Guaranteed end-to-end latency of reads under 10 ms and indexed writes under 15 ms for a typical 1KB item, within the same Azure region, with a median latency under 5 ms.
Latency guaranteed at the 99th percentile for almost real-time response in applications.
Provided with Five well-defined, practical, and intuitive consistency models.
The spectrum varies from strong SQL-like consistency to relaxed NoSQL-like eventual consistency which can be chosen and payed as per requirements.

Cost Management
As Per Microsoft Claims:
5 to 10 times cost effective than a non-managed solution or an on-prem NoSQL solution.
3 times cheaper than AWS DynamoDB or Google Spanner.
Industry-leading, financially backed, comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs) for availability, latency, throughput, and consistency for mission-critical data and money back guarantees to the customers.

Resources
In Azure Cosmos DB, databases are containers for various collections used by each API.

Collections are containers where individual entities are stores.

Container names are API dependent:

DocumentDB and MongoDB: Collection
Gremlin: Graph
Tables: Table
Cosmos DB instance supports many types of resources apart from Databases and Containers.

Types of Resources
System resources : Have a fixed schema - Database accounts, Databases, Collections, Users, Permissions, Stored procedures, Triggers, and UDFs.

User-defined Resources : Documents and attachments with no restrictions on the schema.

In Cosmos DB, all the resources are represented and managed as standard-compliant JSON.

Resource Properties
_rid : Hierarchical, Unique,and system generated resource identifier.
_etag : Concurrency control is made optimistic with it.
_ts : Resource timestamp for last update.
_self : Resource URI - Unique addressable
id : Unique name defined by User(partition key value is same).System generated if undefined.

Underscore (_) prefix in JSON representation represents system generated properties.

Encapsulation
id is a user-defined string (up to 256 charters) of a resource. System generated (for documents) and unique within the scope of a specific parent resource.
_rid is system generated hierarchical resource identifier(RID) for each resource. Entire resource hierarchy along with internal representation is encoded in it, which enforces referential integrity in a distributed manner.
RID is unique within a database account with an internal use for efficient routing without a requirement for cross partition lookups.
_rid and _self values represents a resource in canonical and alternate forms.
Both the id and the _rid properties are supported by REST APIs resource addressing and request routing.

Representation and Addressing Resources
Cosmos DB works with JSON documents of common standard compliance.

Database or its contents can be addressed in two formats:

/dbs/{dbName}/colls/{collName}/docs/{docId}
/dbs/{dbName}/users/{userId}/permissions/{permissionId}
Here /dbs is mandatory which is prefixed with the API endpoint of the database account. Extensions as in above format are added to get the specific resource

Now with a basic understanding of different resource properties, let's take a deeper dive into the resources and their management.

Account Management
Azure portal is commonly used to manage Database account and multiple accounts can be given over an Azure subscription through admin access.

Additionally, REST APIs and client SDKs can also be used to manage accounts.

Database account must be configured on properties of Consistency Policy (default consistency level for all the collections for user-defined resources) and Authorization Keys(read-only keys that provide administrative access to the resources).

Databases
According to Microsoft,

A Cosmos DB database is a logical container of one or more collections and users.
Multiple Databases can be created based on subscription.
Unlimited document storage is provided by partitioning within collections.
Databases are elastic by default, with SSD(GB to PetaBytes) backed document storage and provisioned throughput.
Collection addition/removal supported to meet applicationâ€™s requirements.
It is also a container in user perspective, which itself is a namespace for permissions, access and authorization.
Their resource model is similar to other Cosmos DB Resources, CRUD and enumeration is easily possible using REST APIs or client SDKs.
Guaranteed strong consistency for reading or querying the metadata of a database resource.
If a Database is deleted, users and collections within database becomes inaccessible.

Collections
By Microsoft Definition,

A Cosmos DB collection is a container for your JSON documents.

Collections are SSD-backed, elastic, spanning over multiple physical partitions, and are unlimited in terms of storage and throughput.
Supports automatic indexing.
Configuring the indexing policy of each collection allows you to make performance and storage trade-offs associated with indexing.
Queries over collections is facilitated by Cosmos DB SQL syntax reference.
Syntax supports relational, spatial and hierarchical operators and JavaScript UDFs for further extension.

Multi-document Transactions
Azure Cosmos DB implicitly wraps the JavaScript-based stored procedures and triggers within an ambient ACID transaction. An exception in JavaScript execution aborts the transaction.

It allows:

JSON object Automatic indexing, recovery and concurrency control in database engine.
Assignment, variable scoping, natural control flow expression, and exception handling primitive integration over database transactions directly in JavaScript .
UDFs, triggers and Stored procedures can be registered after creating a collection( to specific collection) using REST APIs or SDKs.

UDFs
Application logic can be written to run directly within a transaction inside of the database engine.
Javascript logic can be modeled as a stored procedure, trigger, or a UDF.
Stored procedures or a triggers can perform queries or CRUD operations in a collection.
UDFs can only be used for queries but not for data manipulation.
Resource governance is Strict reservation-based for multi-tenancy. Only a fixed quantum of operating system resources is provided for stored procedure, trigger, or a UDF.
External JavaScript libraries are prohibited and script blacklisting is enforced resource budgets allocated are exceeded.
UDFs, triggers and Stored procedures with a collection are pre-compiled and stored as byte code and can be managed by REST APIs.

Documents
You can insert, replace, delete, read, enumerate, and query arbitrary JSON documents in a collection(maximum size - 2 MB).
Codification of relationships (between documents ) through distinguishing properties or Special Annotations are not required. This is possible through the power of Cosmos DB SQL syntax w.r.t relational and hierarchical query operators.
Supported by REST APIs and client SDKs.
Database consistency policy defines the read consistency level of documents and can be overridden on a per-request basis.

Media
Binary blobs/media can be stored with Azure Cosmos DB (2 GB / account) or to a remote media store.
An attachment in Cosmos DB is a special (JSON) document that references the media/blob stored elsewhere and stores its metadata.
REST APIs and client SDKs support attachment management.
Read consistency for attachment querying is same as the indexing mode of the collection ( Accountâ€™s consistency policy in case of "consistent").

Users
A Cosmos DB user is a logical namespace for grouping a set of permissions.
Helps implement multi-tenancy.
Permissions for a user correspond to the access control over various collections, documents, attachments, etc.
Users can be mapped to a database, collection or multiple users get dedicated/set of collections.
User management is possible through REST APIs or SDK.
Strong consistency is provided for reading or querying the metadata of a user resource.

Permissions
In access control perspective, database accounts, databases, users, and permission are considered administrative resources, requiring administrative permissions and the master key.
On the other hand, Collections, documents, attachments, stored procedures, triggers, and UDFs are scoped under a given database and considered application resources, requiring resource key.
Master key is required to create a permission resource under a user which in turn generates a resource key.
REST APIs and Client SDKs support permission Management.
Strong consistency is provided for reading or querying the metadata of a permission.

Global Distribution
Cosmos DB currently supports writes to a single region but reads from multiple regions.
Replication and addition/removal of database locations is possible through Global Distribution policies.
Policy changes can be configured for failover testing either automatically or manually in an interactive way through the portal.
Azure Portal facilitates this by, 'replicate data globally' option in Azure Cosmos DB account bindings. It provides a Map with available data centres to interactively add/remove database instances.

Consistency
Azure Cosmos DB provides 5 levels of consistency. Performance and Data confidence are parameters for consistency strategy.

Here is the description for consistency levels:

Strong : Write operation is performed on all the replicas.
Bounded Staleness : Write operation is confirmed on configured no.of replications and reflected in other replications within the configured time.
Session : Reads and Writes are consistent within a user session.
Consistent prefix : Ensure there are no out-of-order reads and writes.
Eventual : No guarantee for ordering in reads.

Throughput
The throughput of Azure Cosmos DB is elastic and scalable and throughput billing depends on the request units.
A Request Unit(RU) is a logical abstraction over all of the physical resources it takes to perform an operation in the database.
It includes things like CPU, Memory, IO, etc., that are required to perform the common CRUD operations.
For example, a read operation on a single record requires 1 RU and a create operation requires up to 5 RUs(since it includes indexing, replication and other checks).
Based on the no.of reads/writes required per sec the RUs can be approximated and the throughput can be configured. The throughput can also be configured to be high at peak times of application usage.

Partitioning
Partition Strategy and partition key are the main elements of partitioning Cosmos DB.
Each collection has its own partition key defining the distribution of data in physical partitions underneath.
There can be any number of values in a partition key and any number of partitions under the hood.
The partition keys are spread over ranges and are managed by the database engine.
Metrics of partition usage can be found and analyzed, to prevent over utilization and throttling.

Indexing
Cosmos DB supports auto-indexing. All the properties and entities ingested into the database of any model are completely indexed while maintaining read and write efficiency.
Cosmos DB supports hash indexes, range indexes and geospatial indexes.
Index policy from account settings further tunes indexing for performance .
Lazy indexing when selected builds the index as a background task using leftover request units on your container.
Further tuning is posssible through, Index paths - a set of included/excluded paths which must be indexed and precision of the index, which is the number of bytes that will be preserved for that index term.

Security
Cosmos DB provides network security, encryption and authorization.

Network Security:

IP Firewalls
Whitelisting secure/trusted URLs.
Encryption:

TLS 1.2 or SSL encryption on requests.
AES Encryption on Physical Storage.
Authorization:

Role-based Authorization model similar to all other Azure models.
Key based data authorization.
Customisable Authorization Tokens.

Change Feed: Change Feed can be read using SDK or Azure Functions and used for updating caches, search indexes, data tiering, migrations, analytics, etc..

Time to Live: Expiration time for documents such as logs, machine-generated data, etc., can be configured over TTL per collection and can be overridden on per document basis in order to purge redundant data on Cosmos DB.

Unique Keys: Data Integrity can be achieved by developers by declaring one of the properties in the collection as a unique key. For example, for a social application, data like Email ID can be declared as a primary key in-order to avoid duplication.

Availability: Manual and automatic failovers can be configured to test the availability of the database.

Backup and Restore: Automatic Backups are taken over every 4 hours and the latest 2 copies are retained. If any collection is deleted, the backup is retained for 30 days. Online backups do not consume any resource units and complete restore can be done to another account and be validated by the user over data corruption.

Pre-Payment: Commitment to Azure Cosmos DB by pre-payment for required resources will save the costs up to 65%. The commitment can be done for either 1 or 3 years as of now.

Azure CLI 2.0
Cosmos DB can be configured with AZure CLI 2.0 Few of the commands are listed here regarding management of Cosmos DB.

Account Management commands include commands for CRUD operations on accounts as well as commands which facilitate the customisation/configuration of Azure account features. Let's have look at the provided Azure commands.

az cosmosdb list-connection-strings --`name`
                                    --`resource-group`

Database Management
CRUD operations can be performed on Databases using the Azure CLI. All the commands have the similar syntax with minor changes

To Create/Update/Delete/Show/Check existence of a Database:
az cosmosdb database {word} --`db-name`
                            [--key]
                            [--name]
                            [--resource-group-name]
                            [--url-connection]
word can be create, update, delete, show or exists

To list all Databases under a Account:
az cosmosdb database list [--key]
                          [--name]
                          [--resource-group-name]
                          [--url-connection]

Collection Management
Collection Management commands also follow a similar pattern as the Database commands with minor changes between themselves.

To Create/Update a Collection:
az cosmosdb collection create/update --`collection-name`
                              --`db-name`
                              [--default-ttl]
                              [--indexing-policy]
                              [--key]
                              [--name]
                              [--partition-key-path]
                              [--resource-group-name]
                              [--throughput]
                              [--url-connection]
[--partition-key-path] is not available under update

To show/delete/check the existence of a collection:
az cosmosdb collection {word} --`collection-name`
                              --`db-name`
                              [--key]
                              [--name]
                              [--resource-group-name]
                              [--url-connection]
word can be show, delete or exists.

Introducing SQL API
Azure Cosmos DB currently supports 5 APIs for different use cases and each with their own set of features.
In this topic, you will get to learn about the most commonly used SQL API.
Azure Cosmos DB evolved from Azure Document DB and the SQL API is the current offering renamed over Document DB API.
The SQL API allows interaction with your NoSQL database using JavaScript and SQL.

Features
SQL API in Cosmos DB offers:
Elastically scalable throughput and storage.
Multi-region replication.
Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax.
JavaScript execution within the database.
Tunable consistency levels.
Automatic Indexing.
Change Feed Support.
Fully managed database and machine resources by Microsoft.
REST API framework and Open sourced SDKs.

Querying
Similar to SQL query language and is based on document identifiers, properties, complex objects or existence of specific properties.
Queries can be done without the need to know or enforce a specific schema on each document.
Stored procedures, triggers and user-defined functions (UDFs) within database can be written in JavaScript.
JavaScript facilitates logic execution in transactional manner within database engine.
Full support for SDKs and REST APIs.

Data Modelling
SQL API stores data in NoSQL form (JSON Documents).
Modelling thumb rule is to remember the database is a distributed and not a single machine SQL database.
Avoid Joins and foreign keys.
Data Model must be able to leverage JSON capability of storing arrays and objects.

Document Management
Portal: The Data Explorer is a tool embedded within the Azure Cosmos DB blade in the Azure Portal that allows you to view, modify and add documents to your SQL API collections.
SDK: SDKs are available across many languages like Python, Java,.Net and Node.Js.
REST API: JSON documents are managed through a well-defined hierarchy of database resources and are addressable using a unique URI.
Data Migration Tool: The open-source data migration tool allows you to import data into a SQL API collection from various sources including MongoDB, SQL Server, Table Storage, Amazon DynamoDB, HBase and other DocumentDB API collections.
